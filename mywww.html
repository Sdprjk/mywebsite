	<h2>What is World Wide Web?</h2>

	<p>World Wide Web, which is also known as a Web, is a collection of websites or web pages stored in web servers and connected to local computers through the internet. These websites contain text pages, digital images, audios, videos, etc. Users can access the content of these sites from any part of the world over the internet using their devices such as computers, laptops, cell phones, etc.</p>

	<h2>History of the World Wide Web</h2>
	<p>The World Wide Web was invented by a British scientist, Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. He was working at CERN at that time. Originally, it was developed by him to fulfill the need of automated information sharing between scientists across the world, so that they could easily share the data and results of their experiments and studies with each other.

CERN, where Tim Berners worked, is a community of more than 1700 scientists from more than 100 countries. These scientists spend some time on CERN site, and rest of the time they work at their universities and national laboratories in their home countries, so there was a need for reliable communication tools so that they can exchange information.

Internet and Hypertext were available at this time, but no one thought how to use the internet to link or share one document to another. Tim focused on three main technologies that could make computers understand each other, HTML, URL, and HTTP. So, the objective behind the invention of WWW was to combine recent computer technologies, data networks, and hypertext into a user-friendly and effective global information system.</p>
