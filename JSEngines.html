<h1>The Engines — JavaScript engines</h1><!--- By Mourriya Harrish K---><!--- this content is copied from zeolearn.com--->
<h2>What are JavaScript Engines?</h2>
<p>JavaScript engines are programs that convert JavaScript code into lower level or machine code.<br>
JavaScript engines follow the ECMAScript Standards. These standards define how the JavaScript engine should work and what features it should have.<br>
In general, higher level languages like JavaScript, C, FORTRAN are abstracted from machine language. JavaScript is much farther abstracted from machine level than C/C++. C/C++ are in comparison much closer to the hardware among other reasons making them much faster than other high-level languages.<br>
Compilation and Interpretation are some general approaches used in code implementation by programming languages.<br>
A compiler is a program that transforms a computer code written in a programming language (source language) into another programming language (target language). They translate a source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language e.g machine code.<br>
An interpreter goes through your source code statement by statement and executes the corresponding machine code directly on the target machine.<br>
An interpreter directly executes (performs instructions written in a programming language).<br>
While interpretation and compilation are the two of the principles by which programming languages are generally implemented, they are not totally unrelated, as most interpreting systems also perform some translation work, just like compilers.<br>
JavaScript is usually categorized as interpreted although it is technically compiled. Modern JavaScript compilers actually perform Just-in-time Compilation which occurs during run-time.<br>
JavaScript engines are embedded in browsers and web servers, such as Node.js to allow run-time compilation and execution of JavaScript code.</p><br>

<p>Google’s V8: It is an open-source JavaScript engine that was developed by The Chromium Project for Google Chrome and Chromium web browsers. The project’s creator is Lars Bak. The first version of the Chrome’s V8 engine was released at the same time as the first version of Chrome: September 2, 2008. It has also been used in server-side technologies like Node.js and MongoDB.<br>
This engine has the Ignition Interpreter used for interpreting and executing low-level bytecodes. Bytecodes, although slower, are smaller than machine codes and requires lesser compilation time. Full-Codegen is a compiler that runs fast and also produces unoptimized code.<br>
The Crankshaft is a slower compiler that produces fast, optimized code.<br> 
TurboFan, the JIT compiler will profile the code and see if it is used multiple times throughout the entire JavaScript execution. The garbage collector will find objects and data that are no longer referenced and collect them.<br>
The V8 engine stops program execution when performing a garbage collection cycle.</p>
